                    <p>The majority of people purchase it for amusement or maximizing profits. Virtual land is commonly purchased for amusement purposes, and then virtual experiences are developed on top of it. A user can build multiple experiences and install a multitude of digital assets on them based on whatever project they have engaged in.</p>
                    <p>People also purchase virtual land in the Metaverse as an investment. One of the major reasons for this is that NFT land is getting progressively scarce. Metaverse users are snatching up parcels in virtual projects at a breakneck pace, causing their prices to skyrocket.</p>
                    <p>On the Metarix blockchain, every piece of land will be denoted by a non-fungible ERC-721 token. Metarix will have 105,000 plots of land purchasable. On the platform, a total of 9 theme parks and 3 islands will be featured. Every theme park will have a maximum of 10,000 plots, while each island will have a total of 5,000 plots. A district could be formed by connecting three or more parcels. An Estate can be formed by joining two or more districts collectively.</p>
