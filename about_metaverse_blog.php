                <h1>THE METARIX METAVERSE</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="blog_details_para">
                <p>The metaverse is a concept of a persistent, online, 3D universe that combines multiple different virtual spaces. You can think of it as a future iteration of the internet. The metaverse will allow users to work, meet, game, and socialize together in these 3D spaces.</p>
                <p>Although not required, cryptocurrencies can be a great fit for a metaverse. They allow for creating a digital economy with different types of utility tokens and virtual collectibles (NFTs). If you read our last blog on blockchain technology, then you’ll understand why it’s a match made in heaven for the metaverse to be on the blockchain.</p>
                <p>One big factor that has influenced the development of blockchain technology, is the need for decentralization.  There is a growing community that is yearning for a financially, economically, socially free environment to live, enjoy life, and do business.  This sentiment is what drove Satoshi Nakamoto to develop cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) to put the power back in the hands in the users.  Cryptocurrency is essentially a decentralized economy sustained by its own supply/demand utilizing its own scarcity and the adoption process to determine its value.  </p>
                <p>Putting the power back into the hands of the people is truly where METARIX comes in. METARIX is a decentralized metaverse that puts decision making power, creative power, financial power, and social freedom at the user’s discretion.   For so long, countries of the world have been dependent on financial institutions of small groups of people making decisions for most of the people.  The METARIX metaverse creates the space for users to create their own economy utilizing their own investments, NFTs, services or commerce.  The METARIX metaverse puts the creative power back in the hands of the user to build out their dreams.  The METARIX Metaverse is everything we would love to experience here in reality, waiting for a user to dream and build.  With the SDK’s and API’s to help the users create their own games, NFTs or digital asset, the tools are in the hands of the dreamer.</p>

                    <h4>THE METARIX DAO</h4>
                </div>
                <div class="metarixs_details_data">
                    <p>A DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization, meaning an organization that governs itself through smart contracts using external information and execute those commands without human intervention.  The benefit of a DAO is giving the users or members of that organization the opportunity to help make decisions on their best interests, meaning the majority of the participants could implement changes that would in fact represent the majority of participants.  In the METARIX DAO the community will be able to make certain decisions that will ultimately reflect their desires inside the METARIX Metaverse.  The keys are being given to the people. </p>

                    <h4>THE METARIX PLATFORM</h4>
                </div>
                <div class="metarixs_details_data">
                    <p>THE METARIX Metaverse will be built and established on it’s own Layer 2 blockchain, the METARIX Chain.  The native currency for the metaverse and blockchain itself will be the METARIX (MTRX).  On this blockchain and from the Metaverse, a smart contract platform exists for blockchain games, Web3.0, NFTs, vendors, businesses, game developers to bring their projects, and bring value and life into the METARIX metaverse.  Bringing more utility to the MTRX token, game developers that use the METARIX SDK services and APIs will have the opportunity to fund raise their project on the METARIX Launchpad, as well as NFT Marketplace support to sell their game supported NFTs and the METARIX DEX to support token sales from within the METARIX Ecosystem.  </p>

                    <p>From VR, to AR, to Mixed Reality, there is no limit to the experiences the user will have in the METARIX.

                    <h4>METARIX Avatars</h4>
                </div>
                <div class="metarixs_details_data">
                    <p>One thing many people underestimate is the sensation of escapism.  No matter your condition, or the quality of life you currently are living, ingrained in a human mind is imagination.  The human mind is created to bring balance and reason to a certain circumstance, while on the other hand, it’s designed to dream and create and wonder and question the status quo.  In the METARIX Metaverse, users will have an NFT avatar to express themselves however they feel at that moment- clothing themselves maybe with clothes or a character they would never dare in the consciousness of reality.  In the METARIX Metaverse, the users expression is not limited to humanity, it’s limited to the human imagination.  Users can become who they think they are, who they’d like to be or who they’d never dare to be in this reality of maybe a 9-5 ordinary Joe existence.  NFT avatars will be available to play with and represent yourself. </p>
